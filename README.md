# Revatry
An alternative web framework for .NET

Needs heavy editing due commented lines of previous code.

Other than its fine

Might be a built dll file too for people lazy to compile stuff

Changing get method beacuse its going to be changed by something else.

Some parts of this project is async performance not being tested yet.

Planning to do some stress test.

It does supports

- Sessions (semi, not tested)
- Pages and virtual pages

Planned:

- Templating using regex
- WebSockets for realtime pages
- Html Compression (server side)
- Html appending on every page so like navbars/sidebars could be easily done
- A custom database system
